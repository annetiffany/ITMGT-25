def body_mass_index(weight, height):
    '''Body Mass Index.
    5 points.

    This function calculates the body mass index (BMI) of a person
        given their weight and height.

    The formula for BMI is: kg / (m ^ 2)
        (i.e., kilograms over meters squared)

    Unfortunately, the users of this function use the imperial system.
        You will need to first convert their arguments to the metric system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weight: float
        the weight of the person, in pounds
    height: list
        the height of the person, expressed as a list of two integers.
        the first integer is the foot component of their height.
        the second integer is the inches component of their height.
        for example, 5'10" would be passed as [5, 10].

    We have not yet discussed lists, but use the skills you developed
        in the command line exercise. How would you learn how to work with
        lists?

    Returns
    -------
